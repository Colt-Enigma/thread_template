Needless to say, ColtOS Project is custom ROM based on AOSP by a team of learners with all the necessary customizations, without compromising the stability and security of the device.
We have cherry-picked the features from many other open-source roms/projects and we are very thankful to all of them!
We try to keep ColtOS as stable as possible, on an off chance you faced any issues with official builds, please let us know via our [URL="https://t.me/ColtEnigma"] official telegram group [/URL] or XDA thread.

[U][B]Team ColtOS[/U][/B]
We, The ColtOS Team, are a bunch of Android enthusiast coming from a wide variety of industries (some of them don't even belong to anything related to programming or coding). But we like what we do.
We are young and growing team of learners. We are still learning and helping each other learn as well. Thanks to entire ColtOS team for giving their precious time to this Project.
